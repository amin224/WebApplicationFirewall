DDoS Mitigation: Identifies and handles Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to maintain service availability.

Flood Prevention: Prevents excessive and rapid requests that could overwhelm the server.

API Security: Implements token validation mechanisms for both POST and GET API requests to ensure secure communication.

Attacker Tool: A dedicated tool was developed to simulate and test various attack scenarios, allowing for robust security evaluation.

Usage
